// edit styles in this file. for most things -- fonts and colors
// in the editor and in the shells -- you should use the Preferences
// file. this file is for changing structural elements of the console.

// for example, to swap the order of editor/shell:

/*
#editor { order: 3; }
#terminals { order: 1; }
*/

// this style is interpreted as `less`; see http://lesscss.org/
